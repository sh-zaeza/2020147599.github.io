------------------------------------
Description of the program:
The program implements a security policy for a house using C. First, when initiated, the owner and initial keys are assigned. The initial keys include the user input and a special firefighter key. Possible commands include:
-> ./secure_house <owner_name> <key_1> <key_2> ... <key_n> // initiation
-> INSERT KEY <user_name> <key>
-> TURN KEY <user_name>
-> ENTER HOUSE <user_name>
-> WHO'S INSIDE?
-> CHANGE LOCKS <user_name> <key_1> <key_2> ... <key_n>
-> LEAVE HOUSE <user_name>
The program responds accordingly and in case a non-listed command is inputted, the program gives out an error message.
------------------------------------
How it works:
The user input is checked on "\n", and if passed, parsed into separate words. The first two words are read and a corresponding response is outputted. The keys and house members are stored in a pre-defined self-growing array and changed/revoked when needed.
