------------------------------------
Description of the program:
The program implements a MAC security policy for a set of files using C. First, when initiated, the program reads mac.policy file with users and their permissions. Possible commands include:
-> ./mac read <file name>
-> ./mac write <file name> <what to write>

The program responds accordingly.
------------------------------------
How it works:
The user input is checked on "\n", and if passed, parsed into separate words. The first two words are read and a corresponding response is outputted and actions are performed.
